Rollback fully and migrate again. Some migrations have been edited.

1) Institutes table has been created. Academics is now the join table between
users and institutes. One-to-one between domain and institute has been created.
What's left is to check the validations, constraints(unique, dependent: :destroy),
indices, etc. dependent: :destroy must be checked and must be used carefully.
Also, the issue of an institute existing in the domains table but not in the
institutes table must be addressed later.

2) has_many through has been implemented between users and groups, replacing
has_and_belongs_to_many. The join table name is groups_users and model name
is GroupsUser. Same things as listed above like validations, etc have to be
checked and implemented.

3) Names of models have not been changes as that is a huge task.

4) domain_id column of articles and questions tables has been removed.

5) Suggestion: Maybe migrate from integer to bigint. Problem faced by Twitter.

6) Suggestion: Default foreign key id names must not be changed.
