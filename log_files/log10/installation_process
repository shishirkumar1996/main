creation of new application 'main' with the following command

rails new -d postgresql main

create new database 'postgres' through this commands
1. CREATE DATABASE <database_name>
2. createdb <database_name> -U <username>

run any db command directly on bash using 

sudo -u postgres <command>



open up postgres in cli through this command

sudo -u postgres psql
or 
psql postgres ( in some systems)


Use following command :-
	1) \l or \list to list all the databases
	2) \dt to list all tables of that particular database
  3) \du to list all users
  
to switch between databases use :-
		\connect <database_name>


create new user and password through this command 

CREATE USER <username> PASSWORD '<password>';
or 
createuser <username>

user ALTER ROLE <username> <list of roles> 
to alter the roles of a user


note: createuser --createdb --login -P <username> can be used directly to ease.--createdb will allow user to create database, --login will allow user to login to the database and -P will allow user to set new user's password right now.(Note - this command might not be present in some installations so this command can be ignored)

for now let the username be main
password be main

make these changes then in the config/database.yml by adding
these lines in all three environments

username: main
password: main

make sure while adding the given lines that there is no indentation using tabs.

also in order to grant priviliges use this command inside postgres server

alter role main  with createdb;

run this command to create databases for all the environment

rails db:create

after creating the databases you can access the database through mainly three ways
1) rails c
2) rails dbconsole
3) psql <database_name>  for eg -  psql main_development
