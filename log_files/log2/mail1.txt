I have a few doubts:

1) How will the website display on a tablet? Same as mobile or same as desktop ??

2) I still have a few doubts about the domains idea :

  i) Check out guruquest.net and Yahoo Answers. They also have the domains idea.
     Domains cannot cover every topic on earth. If users can add their own domains,
     it becomes messy as seen in the above websites. When people post questions, u said
     that they have to choose a domain. What if the domain list is huge? Won't it be
     irritating as seen in the above website which have a lot of domains ??
     
  ii) Just a suggestion: What if we limit the domains initially and add more if 
  	  necessary later on. We can limit the domains to about 10 areas in Engineering 
  	  (as an example) or any other thing. So, we will be targeting specific people and
  	  they will be forced to use our website because ours will be the only one related
  	  to their topic. That way we can retain the domain idea and we can also avoid 
  	  competing with sites like quora and yahoo which focus on all topics.
  	  
  iii) Even if we implement the domain idea, there are topics that belong to multiple
       domains and there will be overlap. What if the person asking the question 
       gets confused ?
  	  
These are just suggestions. It's up to you. So, what do u say ?? If u feel that your
domain idea will work perfectly fine, can u explain to me what your idea is(briefly) ?
