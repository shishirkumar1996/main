a little bit enhancement of plans


we are going to use  wysiwyg editor for inputting answers, questions and articles.

so we will be using ckeditor. it is integrable with rails.
 
an important website to configure the options to change the look and feel of editor and its components.

docs.cksource.com/ckeditor_api/symbols/CKEDITOR.config.html


and we won't be using arrays inside any tables of databases. we will be using one-many or many-many
or one-one relationship
