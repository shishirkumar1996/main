Further prospects

we can add reply options to all the answers on which only the person who has asked the question can
reply. Only the person who has answered can reply back. means it will be an end to end kind of
communication in order to avoid any external unnecessary comments.

we can add mark as duplicate scheme so that a question which has already been asked can not be repeated
or if it is repeated , people will get to know that such kind of question has already been asked.

editing options for any answer is easy, we might think of options for deleting options so that person
can delete some part of their answers.

right now we are not going to add trending topics option as it requires more resources.

notifications bar is easy to implement but more knowledge is needed about it.

we need to think more about deploying this website on server.
