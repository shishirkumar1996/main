config.assets.debug = false

was done in order to load complex assets without preprocessing

other way is to add :debug => false in javascript_include_tag

but we have to segregrate 3rd party js or css files and our own js or css files

therefore 3rd party js or css files might be put inside vendor folder


for addition of new environment we need to precompile the assets for that through this command

RAILS_ENV=<environment_name> rake assets:clean assets:precompile
This command can also be run
RAILS_ENV=<environment_name> bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT = /sub_url


In order to create an analysis html file in tmp/performance, 
just add ?profile_request=true at the end of the web address

Report will be added in tmp/performance folder

Also had to change *html to * html  in vendor/assets/javascripts/ckeditor/plugins/uicolor/yui/assets/yui.css

Had to add gem "non-stupid-digest-assets" in order to make ckeditor to work in profile environment
AFter this precompile the assets

I had to make changes in assets.rb, initializers/ckeditor.rb


Added the line config.assets.prefix = "/assets_dev" in order to avoid precompile assets being served in development environment





added Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( ckeditor/*)
in config/intializers/assets.rb and commented it

Commenting it solved the issue of all loaded plugins
