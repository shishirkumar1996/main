you are right about limiting the domain. we can easily limit them. means its not a big deal.
on tablet ,there are two ways people can see the website, one is vertically and other is horizontally,
so maybe we can force the website to show it just vertically(it works).


ok initially we wont give an option to people to create domains.

as you are saying about multiple domains, i am already letting people enter their question and 
then  choose all the domains to it which pertain to. there will be a thing callled domain tag 
on the top of every question of article which will allow people to know that this question belongs 
to these domains. we just have to improve the look and feel of the domain tags bar as i have already shown
in the pictures.
